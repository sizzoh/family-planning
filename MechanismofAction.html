<p>
    <strong>Mechanism of Action
    </strong>
<ul>
    <li>Its primary mechanism of action works by causing a chemical change (non inflammatory chemical reaction) in the uterus that damages sperm and ovum before they can meet.</li>
   <li>Studies have found that the TCu-380A is effective for 12 years. TheTCu-380A is labeled for up to 10 years of use, however.</li>
   <b>How Effective?</b>
    <li>One of the most effective and long-lasting methods:</li>
   <li>Less than 1 pregnancy per 100 women using an IUD over the first year (6 per 1,000 women who use the IUD perfectly, and 8 per 1,000 women as commonly used). </li>
   <li>This means that 992 to 994 of every 1,000 women using IUDs will not become pregnant.</li>
    

<strong>Side Effects
</strong><br>
<p>Some users report the following:</p>
<li>Changes in bleeding patterns (especially in the first 3 to 6 months), including:</li>
<li>Prolonged and heavy monthly bleeding</li>
<li> Irregular bleeding</li>
<li>More cramps and pain during monthly</li>
<li>Bleeding changes are normal and not harmful. If a woman finds them bothersome, counseling and support can help.</li>
</ul>
   </ul><br>
