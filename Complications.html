<p>
    <strong>Complications (Uncommon):
    </strong>
<ul>
    Infection at insertion site (most infections occur within the first 2 months after insertion)
    Difficult removal (rare if properly inserted and the provider is skilled
    at removal)<br>
    <strong>Rare:</strong><br>
     Expulsion of implant (expulsions most often occur within the first 4 months after insertion)<br>
    <strong>Extremely rare</strong> <br>
    There are a few reports of implants found in another place in the body due to improper insertion, for example, in a blood vessel.
    

</ul>
<strong>Correcting Misunderstandings
</strong><br>
<b>Implants:</b><br>
Do not work once they are removed. Their hormones do not remain in a woman’s body.<br>
Do not cause any harm if they stop monthly bleeding. This is similar to not having monthly bleeding during pregnancy. Blood is not building up inside the woman.<br>
Do not make women infertile.<br>
Do not increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy

   </ul><br>

• If she reports a current blood clot in legs (affecting deep veins, not superficial veins) or in a lung and she is not on anticoagulant therapy.<br>

     <strong>Avoid Unnecessary Procedures</strong><br>
    Women can begin using implants:<br>
    Without a pelvic examination<br>
    Without any blood tests or other routine laboratory tests<br>
     Without cervical cancer screening<br>
     Without a breast examination<br>
     Without a pregnancy test. A woman can have implants inserted at any time, even when she is not having monthly bleeding, if it is reasonably certain she is not pregnant<br>
     <br>
<strong>When to start
</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Immediately after delivery/abortion</li>
<li>When breast feeding (if within 6 month, no need of back up method)</li>
<li>If her monthly bleeding has not returned, she can have implants inserted any time if it is reasonably certain she is not pregnant. </li>
<li>She will need a backup method for the first 7 days after insertion.</li>
<li>If her monthly bleeding has returned, she can have implants inserted as advised for women having menstrual cycles
Shift from other method without a need for backup</li>

  </ul>
<strong>Copper-Bearing</strong>
<ul>
    <li>The copper-bearing intrauterine device (IUD) is a small, flexible plastic frame with copper sleeves or wire around it. </li>
   <li>A specifically trained health care provider inserts it into a woman’s uterus through her vagina and cervix.</li>
   <li>Almost all types of IUDs have one or two strings, or threads</li>
    <b>Long-term pregnancy protection. </b>
    <li>Shown to be very effective for up to 12 years, immediately reversible.</li>
    <li>Inserted into the uterus by a specifically trained provider.</li>
    <li>Little required of the client once the IUD is in place.</li>
    <li>Bleeding changes are common. </li>
    - Typically, longer and heavier bleeding and more cramps or pain during monthly bleeding, especially in the first 3 to 6 months.
